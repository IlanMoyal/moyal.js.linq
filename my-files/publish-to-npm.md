ðŸš€ Letâ€™s Publish Version 1.0.0 to NPM (Step 1)
âœ… Step 1: Ensure you're logged in
bash
Copy
Edit
npm login
It will ask for your username, password, and 2FA (if enabled).

If you're not registered yet, go to:
ðŸ”— https://www.npmjs.com/signup

âœ… Step 2: Verify package.json is ready
Check that these fields are correct:

 âœ… If this is your first time publishing a package:

Consider renaming the "name" to something more unique, like:

"name": "@yourusername/moyal.js.test"

(You can always republish later under a different name for the real version)

âœ… Step 3: Run a final dry run pack
Just to see what will be published:

npm pack

Check the contents:
tar -tf moyal.js.test-1.0.0.tgz


âœ… Step 4: Publish!
npm publish

If you're using a scoped package like @ilanmoyal/moyal.js.test, you may need to publish it publicly:

npm publish --access public


If it works, you'll see output like:

+ @moyal/js-test@1.0.0


ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations â€” youâ€™re published!
